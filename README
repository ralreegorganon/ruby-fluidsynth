Ruby bindings for the FluidSynth software synthesizer.

This is effectively a copy of pyFluidSynth
(http://pypi.python.org/pypi/pyFluidSynth) minimally changed to be valid Ruby.
The parts requiring Python-specific components (numpy and pyaudio) have
been removed, namely get_samples and test2. Otherwise, the interface is exactly
the same.
